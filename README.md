# Exploratory Data Analysis of Health Insurance Costs

## Background
This report presents an exploratory data analysis (EDA) of health insurance costs using a dataset containing demographic and health-related information of insurance policyholders. The primary objective of this analysis is to uncover patterns, trends, and relationships within the data, providing valuable insights into the factors influencing insurance charges.

## Objectives
1. To explore the distribution and central tendencies of key variables (age, bmi, charges, etc.).

2. To identify relationships and correlations between variables.

3. To detect and analyze outliers in the dataset.

4. To visualize data patterns and trends using various plots and charts.

5. To derive meaningful insights that can inform future decision-making and policy development in the healthcare insurance sector.

## Research Questions
**What are the primary factors influencing health insurance charges?**

**What trends are observed in charges across different age groups and regions?**

**Are there correlations between BMI, age, and charges?**

## Data Description
The dataset representing the insurance health was found on kaggle.com website, containing 1,338 information about the dataset. It contains age, sex, bmi, children, smoker, region and charges. It was found that it has a few outliers and duplicates which were addressed during the data cleaning process, with zero missing values.

## Methodology
### 1. Data Cleaning:

Handle missing values, duplicates, and inconsistencies to ensure data quality.

### 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Create visualizations (histograms, scatter plots, box plots, heatmaps) to explore patterns, relationships, and trends.

### 3. Outlier Detection:

Identify and analyze outliers in the dataset using appropriate methods.

### 4. Summary and Reporting:

Summarize findings and insights from the analysis, and compile them into a comprehensive report.

## Significance
The analysis provides a deeper understanding of the factors influencing health insurance costs. By identifying key patterns and relationships within the data, we can make informed decisions to improve healthcare insurance policies and strategies.
## Summary of Key Findings
1. **Relationship Insights**:
    Positive correlation between age and charges indicates that older policyholders tend to incur higher medical costs. Higher charges are observed among smokers compared to non-smokers, highlighting smoking's impact on insurance costs.
2. **Regional Differences**:
    Significant variation in charges across different regions, with some regions incurring higher costs.
3. **Outliers**:
    Identification of outliers in bmi and charges helped in understanding extreme values and their impact on the dataset.

## Limitations
The dataset may contain inaccuracies or missing information not captured during the cleaning process. Analysis does not account for external variables (e.g., economic conditions, healthcare policies) that could influence insurance costs.

## Implications
Insights can inform healthcare insurance policies by highlighting the impact of age and smoking on insurance costs.Identifying high-risk groups (e.g., smokers, older individuals) allows insurers to design better risk management strategies and personalized plans.

## Future Work
Enrich the analysis by incorporating external data sources to provide a more comprehensive view.
